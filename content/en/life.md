## Ancestry
Jean (later Johann and Jan), the son of a French nobleman, Jean de Montalban, was probably born in Vienna on the 21st of November 1799, where he was baptized in St. Stephen’s Cathedral. At first he used his father’s surname, de Montalban. Jean de Montalban – father, fled his homeland to avoid the terror of the French Revolution and settled in Vienna. Later, he was killed in the Battle of Wagram on the 5th or 6th of July, 1809. After the death of his father, ten-year-old Jean was adopted by his Austrian tutor - Joseph Ruckgaber. His French Christian name - Jean - was later altered to Johann and Jan. He was buried in Lviv as Jan Ruckgaber.

## Education
He started his musical education in Vienna with Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was an Austrian composer, pianist, theoretician and teacher, of Slovak origin. Later he continued his studies in Paris, presumably in the years 1816-1819.  										

## First concerts 
Jan Ruckgaber first visited Lviv in 1815. In January 1818, still as a student, he came again, gave a number of successful concerts and gained some popularity.         	
From 1820 Ruckgaber came to Lviv on regular basis and participated in the concert life of the town. He performed in solo piano concerts, accompanied local musicians and soon gained the fame of an irreplaceable accompanist.

In the years 1824-25 J. Ruckgaber participated as an accompanist in Karol Lipiński’s subscription concerts. In the same year of 1825, both musicians – a violinist Karol Lipiński and a pianist Jan Ruckgaber jointly gave a series of concerts in Kiev and Lviv. Co-operation with Lipiński later inspired Ruckgaber to compose instrumental pieces of chamber music. He also dedicated his first piano concerto, opus 20 to him.
In 1826 Ruckgaber settled in Lviv for good. He played concerts, worked as a piano tutor, and a composer.  His music was then published by Franz Piller’s printing house in Lviv. It was mainly dance music: polonaises, mazurkas, cotillions, romances and songs.


## Family
On the 15th of August 1834, at the age of nearly 35, Jan Ruckgaber married Maria Xavier Markl, who was born in Lviv, on the 8th of August 1819. She was the daughter of a Hungarian baron John Markl and a Polish woman Jane née Balewicz. They had six children:

**Ferdinand** – also a soldier, died at a young age.

**Stephanie** – married to Jacob Kobiałkiewicz. They had two daughters: Jane and Sophia.

**Jane**, called Żańcia – cared for her elderly father in Lviv. Her husband, Joseph Schier, Ernest’s wife’s brother, died in Vienna. They had no children.

**Ernest** (died in 1888) – a captain in the Austrian army. Allegedly, a dog saved his life when it found him severely wounded under bodies of soldiers killed in a battle. He was married to Anna Schier (the sister of Joseph, Jane Ruckgaber’s husband), the daughter of a Scotswoman, Anna Scarley and Joseph Schier, a Lviv jeweler. They had three children: Kazimiera, Jan and Olga. (Jan, the son of Ernest and the grandson of the composer, was my grandfather – a note by Andrzej Ruckgaber). Ernest's branch of relatives is presently living in Warsaw.

**Angela** – was taken away by her mother when she left her husband and Lviv in 1862.

A gifted musician, admired as a pianist and a composer of popular music, Jan Ruckgaber was a lively, charismatic figure. He played piano concerts in many European towns. In the mid-1840s, in Paris he met Fryderyk Chopin and Ferenc Liszt, an eminent Hungarian composer and a legendary piano virtuoso.  

From scratch did he organize the Galician Music Society. He laid the foundation under professional music education in Lviv, staring Music School in 1839 and, a few years later, a Conservatoire, which works till the present days, now under the name of the Lviv National Music Academy. During over fifty years of his public activity, Jan Ruckgaber educated three generations of musicians and music-lovers and earned respect and admiration of Lviv musical circles. 

## Decline

In 1857, due to his illness Ruckgaber withdrew from working for the Society, but he still worked as a tutor and composer. After parting with his wife, in 1862 he left for Wołoszczyzna, and in 1867, he returned to Lviv and came to stay with his beloved daughter Jane.

Jan Ruckgaber died in Lviv, on the 5th of January 1876. He was buried at the Łyczakowski Cementery, in a Schiers’s family tomb (Joseph and Anna Schier’s, Jane’s husband’s parents’).
Later, his daughter Jane opened his last will – reportedly full of bitterness and reproach towards his unfaithful wife, but also containing information as to the return to the true family name. Unfortunately, she destroyed it later in defense of her mother’s good memory and thus the only link to recovery the family surname was cut.
