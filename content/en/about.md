My name is Ruckgaber, Andrzej Ruckgaber. I was born in Poland and I am certainly Polish, but the foreign name has always made me think about the origin of my ancestors.
Not only curiosity, but also the family tale, did incline me to take up the story of my great-great-grandfather, Jan Ruckgaber, who was a popular 19th century musician. Now forgotten, he was a pianist, composer, a teacher and promoter of musical life in Lviv.

Standing, pictured from the left: Alicja Okońska, the daughter of Jan Ruckgaber (my grandfather, the composer’s grandson), her two brothers Zdzisław and Zbigniew (my father), Janina (my mother), and Kalinka, Alicja Okońska’s daughter. Sitting, from the left: my grandmother Leonia with Jan Ruckgaber (her husband and my grandfather), myself – Andrzej Ruckgaber and down in front of our grandpa, my younger sister, Monika. In the bottom-right corner there is a friend of my grandparents’. The photo was taken on my grandparents’ 56th wedding anniversary, in 1955 (family archive)">}}

We think of Jan Ruckgaber as a Pole, but his parents were French aristocrats who fled to Vienna in the days of the French Revolution. When his father was killed in the Battle of Wagram, Jean, then a boy of ten, was adopted by his tutor, an Austrian named Joseph Ruckgaber, whose surname is now also mine. 

He spent most of his lifetime in Lviv, a Polish town bustling with Polish culture, although Poland did not then exist on the map of Europe.

When Poland gained independence in 1918, Ruckgaber’s descendants moved to Warsaw, carrying with them the family story about their famous grandfather: the composer.
Thus a French aristocrat, then a Viennese emigrant with an Austrian surname, Galician citizen and a popular figure in Lviv, he began the Polish branch of the family. 
His fate seems symbolic for the tangled history of Europe.  
The goal of our website is to reveal his story to the widest public.
