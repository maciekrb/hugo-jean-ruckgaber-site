Józef Elsner’s Musical Academy, open in the years 1796-97 and active in the years 1826-33, F.X. Mozart’s Society of St. Cecilia, together with the Singing Institute established by the Society of St. Cecilia by Mozart and Lipiński, were the first musical societies in Lviv59. 
In the early 1830s, Jan Ruckgaber and F.X. Mozart56 set up the Society of Friends of Music (Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde)8, which soon became a foundation for the Galician Music Society.


The Society of Friends of Music was officially registered on the 14th of August 1838, under the name of The Galician Music Society (GMS, Galizische Musikverein – GMV)85. Later in 1838 Franz Xavier Mozart left for Vienna, and Jan Ruckgaber replaced him in the musical activity. In the years 1838-42, the Society worked under his direction as an art manager. Ruckgaber, who was also the conductor of the orchestra and choirs and later the manager of a music school at the Society, established in 18398,80,85. 
Soon the Society started organizing weekly musical meetings in which amateur-musicians performed music by Mozart, Beethoven and others.

The period of best prosperity for the Galician Music Society and cultural life came in the years 1842-48. At that time the society held tens of concerts, festivities, charity events and organized numerous musical meetings. Ruckgaber invited the most eminent musicians in Europe to perform in Lviv41,69. The public was most impressed by violinist Bedřich Smetana (1843), pianist Libra Ottawa (1844), violinist Heinrich Ernst (1845), cellist Marek Bauer (1843) and pianist Leopold Mayer (1843), but it was Ferenc Liszt who performing for the whole month at the turn of April and May, 1847, broke records of popularity. 
In 1848, the revolutionary events ceased the activity of the school at the GMS41.

## The Springtime of the Peoples
The wave of revolutionary events of 1848, generally called the Spring of the Peoples, spread over the Austrian Empire and raised a wide echo in Galicia. 
In November 1848, due to a shellfire of the town, the center was seriously damaged. The university building and its library, with valuable Polish materials and antique books, were burnt down, the same happened with the technical university, the town hall and the theater. 
The Galician Music Society suspended its activity.

## The New Beginning
When the events had settled down, in June 1852, the Galician Music Society was renewed as The Society for the Development of Music in Galicia. On personal order by the Emperor Franz Joseph I the school received a three volume collection of J. S. Bach’s works29,51.
The Society’s concert activity was soon restarted and under Ruckgaber’s direction the orchestra prepared many symphonic works and fragments of operas, including the overture to The Summer Night’s Dream, the oratorio Saint Paul and The Piano Concerto G-minor by F. Mendelssohn, the Fourth Symphony and The Pastoral Symphony by L. van Beethoven and his oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives (Christus am Ölberge), oratorio The Creation by J. Haydn and symphonic ode The Desert by F.C. David12,86. 

## The Conservatoire
{{<figure src="/images/lviv-gms-and-conservatoire.png" width="320" class="short-caption" alt="GMS building and conservatoire in Lviv" caption="Lviv in a modern photo: the building of the GMS and its Conservatoire, constructed in 1910  (at present the Lviv Philharmonic)  (http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl, Jan.2015)">}}
The music school at the society was reopened on the 1st of May 1854, this time as a Conservtoire. The Conservatoire at the Galician Music Society, was one of the oldest in Europe, older than the conservatoires in Petersburg (eatablished in 1862) and in Moscow (1864).
 
 At first it was led by the director Jan Ruckgaber. Art of composition was taught along with theoretical subjects, as harmonics, counterpoint, instrumentation and analysis of music forms. From the first years of the Galician Music Society, Ruckgaber gathered repertoire for a music library, whose collection  was even enriched when the conservatoire was established. 
In 1906, the GMS and the Conservatoire  moved to a new building, and in 1910 a new concert hall, with excellent acoustics and new organ was put into use. Presently the Lviv Philharmonic is placed there. 

World War I thwarted the GMS and Conservatoire achievements. Many students and teachers were taken into the army, professors did not receive their earnings for some time, and later their pay was cut to one third. In 1914/15 there were only 119 students, but as soon as in 1916/17 the conservatoire started returning to normal life.

After the second disaster of World War II the Conservatoire took up its activity as the Lviv National Music Academy. After many years and changing fortunes the Conservatoire still works, becoming the M. Łysenko Lviv State Musical Academy after 1999, and taking the name of M. Łysenko Lviv National Musical Academy from 2008. 
In the year 2004, the institution, once established by Jan Ruckgaber, celebrated its 150th anniversary.

{{<figure src="/images/kenst-das-meer.png" width="320" class="short-caption" alt="Kenst-das Meer" caption="Kennst das Meer, op. 68 (family archive)">}}
The Society existed for 100 years – from 1838 to 1939, between 1919 and 1939 as the Polish Music Society and it was the most important institution for the popularization of music and for organizing musical life in Lviv and Galicia in the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century.
The Society was the first serious educational institution not only in Galicia, but also (except for Prague) – in Eastern Europe. Opening a Music School in 1839, and in 1853 – the Conservatoire, the Galician Music Society started professional music education in Lviv.
